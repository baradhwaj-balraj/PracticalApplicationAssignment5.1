#  Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will The Customer Accept The Coupon?
## This exercise is a deep dive into a dataset that from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver.
### In the attached folder there is a Jupyter notebook in which data analysis was performed to determine will the driver accept the coupon based on a variety of different variables.  [Jupyter Notebook](http://localhost:8890/lab/tree/Project5.1/BalrajPracticalApplicationAssignment.ipynb)
###  Some of The Findings Were: 
##### - From data can infer that people who went to the bar 3 or less times were more likely to accept coupons.
##### - From data can infer that people who went to bar more than once a month and are older than 25 tend to accept coupons more that any other group who also went to bar.
##### - From data it is evident that about 88% of people that went for Carry Out accepted coupons.
##### - From data can infer that people who go for Carry Out while being in a relationship tend to accept coupon more than people who are not in relationships.
##### - From data can infer that people who are in a relationship and have a kid tend to accept coupon more than people who are in a relationship and dont have kids.
##### - From data can infer that people who are in a relationship have kids and get Carry Out 4 or more times a month have a higher chance of accepting coupons than same group of people that go less than 4 times a month.
### Some Future Steps Are:
##### - Find out data about drivers that go to different locations where coupons are accepted and analyze coupon data for those locations.
##### - Analyze data regarding people who refuse coupons and see if there is anything in common with the people who refuse coupons.
##### - Analyze if income has any impact on coupons being accepted or rejected.
